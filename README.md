# Aquarium_InfluxConti
Python script to poll tentacle shield over serial and save data to influxdb

I use this script to collect data from my temp/ph/ec probe and save it to TICK stack running locally.
Edit row 32-36 and row 63 to suit you.

My arduino is using the i2c_asynchronous example from whitelabs.
